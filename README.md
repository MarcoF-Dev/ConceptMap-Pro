ConceptMap Pro is a powerful web app that turns your ideas into interactive concept maps. Whether you’re brainstorming, studying, or planning a project, ConceptMap Pro helps you visualize and organize information in a smart and intuitive way.

With ConceptMap Pro, you can create maps **manually** or **automatically** using AI. Manual mode gives you full control over nodes, connections, and layout. AI-assisted mode analyzes your text and generates an initial map, which you can then refine manually.

**⚠️ Note:** The app is now **responsive**, but the concept map may **not be fully visible on mobile devices**. For the best experience, it is **recommended to use a desktop**, and once the map is created, press the **download button** to save it.

## About This Project

ConceptMap Pro is also a **learning exercise** designed to explore and practice key web development skills:

- Working with **Canvas** and **SVG** for dynamic, interactive graphics.  
- Using **JavaScript libraries** to handle drag & drop, layout, and interactivity.
