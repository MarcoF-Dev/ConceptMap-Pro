ConceptMap Pro is a powerful web app that turns your ideas into interactive concept maps. Whether you’re brainstorming, studying, or planning a project, ConceptMap Pro helps you visualize and organize information in a smart and intuitive way.

With ConceptMap Pro, you can create maps **manually** or **automatically** using AI. Manual mode gives you full control over nodes, connections, and layout. AI-assisted mode analyzes your text and generates an initial map, which you can then refine manually.

**⚠️ Note:** This app is currently designed for desktop use and is **not optimized for mobile devices**.
